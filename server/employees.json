No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.

To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"},{"id":"6","firstName":"Carts","lastName":"Jilly","position":"hr","role":"user","experience":"2","shortDescription":"exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip","longDescription":"Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus.

In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."},{"id":"9","firstName":"Figue","lastName":"Xexy","position":"hr","role":"user","experience":62,"shortDescription":"in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur","longDescription":"The earliest known occurrences of Lorem ipsum passages are on Letraset dry-transfer sheets from the early 1970s, which were produced to be used by graphic designers for filler text."},{"id":"10","firstName":"Nat","lastName":"Gedyle","position":"developer","role":"user","experience":8,"shortDescription":"Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident","longDescription":"Nowadays a variety of software, including text and plug-ins, can generate semi-random 'lorem-like text', which often has little or nothing in common with the canonical adaptations other than looking like (and often being) jumbled Latin. Apple's Pages and Keynote software employ such jumbled text as sample screenplay layout. Lorem ipsum is also featured on Joomla!, Google Docs, and WordPress web content managers. Microsoft Word 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2016 have a lorem ipsum feature.[5] Several LaTeX packages produce Lorem-ipsum-style text."}]
